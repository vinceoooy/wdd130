        Hello everyone, I'm Vince. I'm 23 years old and I've been in the church since birth. Philippines is my home country and also where I served my mission in 2018-2020. 
        I love long road trips with my bike, all sorts of videos games, basketball, and playing the piano (pop genre). I'm still on the dating phase of my life and it's kinda rough for me, 
        I would love to receive tips and encouragements.

        I was first studying a medical course for 2 years when covid was still fresh. Later on, the pandemic really took a toll on me financially, so I landed on a home-based IT related job. 
        Having these circumstances, I realized that the world is changing and becoming more "high-tech". Therefore, I changed my career path.

        I enrolled in college and at the same time BYU-Pathway with courses that are related to my new career. In less than one year, I dropped my college and focused on our wonderful program. 
        I value quality education and I know that the Lord do too. Now I'm enrolled in BYU-Idaho to attain a bachelor's degree in Software Development so that I can contribute in making our 
        world better, easier, and faster. Thank you for reading and I hope we can help each other to ace this course.
